# Project Structure : backend-TaskMate

## Create A backend-TaskMate Repo

### Following are the folders in our repo

- controllers
- db
- routes
- schemas

### Following are the files in our repo

- .env
- .gitignore
- package-lock-json
- package.json
- README.md
- server.js

### Very Important step :

- Don't forget to put `.env` file and node_modules in `.gitignore` file.

- Create a git Repo and follow the steps of Github.

### Commands to install all dependencies which we required for backend project

- step 1 : install `npm init -y ` it will create package.json file
- step 2 : install other depenencies which is required for backend development \
  `npm install express cors mongoose dotenv cloudinary multer multer-storage-cloudinary`
- step 3 : install dev depenencies
  `npm i nodemon colors -D`

### Create a MongoDB Database Connection

- Mongodb Link https://www.mongodb.com/atlas

### First craete important files

- create `.env ` file
- create `.gitignore ` file
- create `server.js` File
- create `dbinit.js ` file inside `db` folder

### Create a Schemas for

Create schemas reequired for TASKMATE services. \
Inside Schemas Folder

- Customer.js
- Professional.js
- Service.js
- ServiceCategory.js
- Booking, BookingForOther.js
- Favourite.js
- Feedback.js
- FAQ.js
- Payment.js

created controllers and Routes for each schemas

- npm install iso-datestring-validator
- backend validates date in ISO 8601 UTC format , same format stored in MongoDB.
- this makes representaion of the date according to user's browser Locale and timezone easier

## ## Date Validation and Storage in ISO 8601 UTC Format

To implement date validation in ISO 8601 UTC format, follow these steps:

1. Install the required package:

2. Implement backend validation:

- The backend validates dates in ISO 8601 UTC format.
- The same format is stored in MongoDB.

3. Benefits:

- This approach makes representation of the date according to the user's browser locale and timezone easier.
- It ensures consistency across different parts of the application.

By using ISO 8601 UTC format, you maintain a standardized date-time representation in your database while allowing flexible display options on the client-side.
